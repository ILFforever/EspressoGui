# EspressoGui
A modern GUI-based wrapper for the [**Espresso logic minimizer**](https://github.com/Gigantua/Espresso). EspressoGui makes it easier to work with the powerful logic minimization algorithms developed at the **University of California, Berkeley**, by providing an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features
- **Modern GUI:** Simplifies interaction with Espresso by providing a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
[Espresso Logic Minimizer](https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm) (bundled with the application)

### Steps
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ILFforever/EspressoGui/releases) page.
2. Extract the zip file to your desired location.

4. Input required fields (Input, Output, Truth-Table)
5. Press Calculate
> **Note:** No additional installation steps are required as all dependencies are included in the package.

## Usage
1. Launch the application by double-clicking `EspressoGUI.exe`.
2. Input your logic functions in the provided text box.
